# BIO

I received my B.Sc. in Ecology and Biodiversity in 2013 and my Ph.D. in Cetacean Ecology from the University of Hong Kong in 2021. My doctoral research focused on the foraging ecology of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong, employing a multifaceted approach, with specialised research area in cetacean ecology, underwater soundscape ecology, and microplastic analysis using advanced spectroscopic techniques.

My work on foraging ecology is based on stable isotope analysis through incremental sampling of growth layer groups. My enthusiasm for acoustic research began with an interest in understanding how dolphins communicate, which further developed into a comprehensive exploration of acoustic research techniques, including point-based recording, long-duration passive acoustic recording, and acoustic line-transect studies. My interest also extends to applying analytical skills in big data analysis and Bayesian belief networks.

Currently serving as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Derek has further developed my skills in microplastic analysis since 2021. He also held the position of Researcher at the Cetacea Research Institute in Hong Kong since 2018. Derek has been committed to advancing the comprehension of marine ecosystems and their interactions with anthropogenic influences.

# Research Interests

- Marine Mammal Ecology: Employing hierarchical Bayesian analysis for weaning age to decipher developmental dietary shifts. Analysis of stomach contents and stable isotope techniques to unravel diet composition and resource partitioning among subpopulations; Reproductive processes such as reproductive patterns, gestation periods; how effects of environmental variables, social structures, and anthropogenic pressures on reproductive rates and population viability.

- Underwater Soundscapes: The significance of sound in aquatic environments covers marine organisms' use of sound for communication, navigation, and foraging, as well as the impacts of human-induced noise pollution. Efforts focus on mitigating adverse effects and preserving marine acoustic habitats.

- Microplastics and its impacts: Distribution and impact processes of microplastic particles in marine environments; how these particles are ingested by marine life and the subsequent ecological risks, including potential harm to marine species and disruption of food webs.
