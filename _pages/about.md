I hold a Bachelor of Science in Ecology and Biodiversity (2013) and a Doctor of Philosophy in Cetacean Ecology (2021) from the University of Hong Kong. My doctoral research investigated the foraging ecology of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong, employing a comprehensive approach with specialized expertise in cetacean ecology, underwater soundscape ecology, and microplastic analysis utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques. Currently, I’m a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I’ve honed my microplastic analysis skills since 2021. Before that, I worked as a Research Scientist at the Cetacea Research Institute in Hong Kong from 2015 to the present.

My work on foraging ecology is based on stable isotope analysis through incremental sampling of growth layer groups. My interest in acoustic research began with an interest in understanding how dolphins communicate, which further developed into a comprehensive exploration of acoustic research techniques, including point-based recording, long-duration passive acoustic recording, and acoustic line-transect studies. My interest also extends to applying analytical skills in big data analysis and Bayesian belief networks.
