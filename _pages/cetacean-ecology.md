Abstract: Weaning represents a pivotal ontogenetic process for mammals, marking the transition from parental provisioning to independent foraging. In monophyodont species, distinct growth layer groups that are deposited in their teeth as the animals age represent a permanent chronological archive of physiological events across the animals’ lifetimes. Thus, biochemical analysis of annual dentine increments provides a means to explore animal physiological history. We examined the age-specific pattern, individuallevel variations, and sex-related differences in dentine nitrogen isotopic values in the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (_Sousa chinensis_) using tooth samples collected from 38 carcasses that stranded ashore in the Pearl River Delta region, southeast China, between 2007 and 2018. The longitudinal isotopic records archived in dolphin teeth offered insights into their foraging ecology and individual ontogenetic dietary life history. The overall pattern of d15N isotopic values in the incremental layers, analyzed under a hierarchical Bayesian framework, indicates that humpback dolphins typically undergo an ontogenetic dietary shift (i.e., wean) before reaching the age of 3 yr (mean: 2.394 5 0.143 yr), albeit there is considerable individual heterogeneity (range: 1.548– 4.180 yr), with males consistently weaning∼3.5 mo earlier than females. Our study underscores the importance of quantifying ontogenetic parameters at the individual level, as overlooking individual variations in life history events (such as the age of weaning) may introduce biases in the broader population-level life history metrics. The application of hierarchical Bayesian modeling proved effective in quantifying individual heterogeneity and factoring it into the estimates of ontogenetic dietary shifts—an important component in analyses of broader population-level processes.

## Reproductive dynamics of an inshore delphinid reflect demographic consequences of large-scale coastal constructions [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-logo?style=flat-square&logo=Github&color=000000)](https://github.com/YuenWaHo/BC-sousa-repro)

Published in _Biological Conservation_ [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/10.1016%2Fj.biocon.2024.110690-logo?style=flat-square&label=DOI&labelColor=a9bcc2&color=edf1f0)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110690)

Abstract: In fast-developing regions, rapid coastal urbanization has led to considerable transformation of both landscapes and seascapes, with various adverse implications for species dependent on inshore habitats. As reliable estimates of vital demographic rates reflect the population-level responses to stressors, rigorous quantification of these parameters is central to assessing the consequences of human-induced environmental change. As a case-in-point, we quantified the reproductive parameters and calf survivorship of an obligatory inshore delphinid, the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (_Sousa chinensis_), in the anthropogenic seascape of Hong Kong prior and during two consecutive large-scale coastal infrastructure projects. Our 8-year photo-ID mark-recapture dataset was examined with both frequentist and Bayesian techniques. The reproductive output of female dolphins worsened significantly following the onset of construction activities, eventually declining alarmingly close to zero. Annual recruitment rate followed a similar trajectory. Concurrently, calf survival rates (pooled across the study period) were low, with <60% of newborns surviving the first 3-month and <46% surviving their first year of life. Both mean crude birth rate (~0.03) and annual recruitment rate (~0.02) were among the lowest reported for coastal delphinids to date. Cumulatively, all of this slows population recruitment and increases population susceptibility to stochastic events. We conclude that natural factors alone are not likely to cause such critically low demographic rates, underscoring the vulnerability of obligatory inshore species to growing anthropogenic pressure and habitat loss in fast-changing coastal seas. We emphasize the need for proactive (instead of reactive) conservation based on reliable sentinel model system and wise use of the precautionary principle.

## Resources Partitioning using Stable Isotope Analysis

_Manuscript in Preparation_

The longitudinal isotopic records archived in dolphin teeth and analysed in this study demonstrate that fine-scale dentine isotopic values vary between sexes and regions, signifying the intra-specific foraging patterns. The results indate that male humpback dolphins occupied a larger isotopic niche area and consumed prey items from a more depleted carbon sources. Isotopic niche area were shown to decrease towards the western side of the PRD region, with a considerable overlap in niche space between adjacent regions. The isotopic niche area were shown to decrease as the total fishery production increase, likely suggesting the effect of anthropogenic pressure on resource consumption pattern of humpback dolphins throughout the study period.

## Interplay of Natural Toxins and Anthropogenic Contaminants in Species-Specific Seawater Cytotoxicity: Insights from Cetacean Skin Fibroblasts

In this study, we utilized cell lines derived from sentinel species indicative of marine ecosystem health – specifically, the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and the humpback dolphin – as _in vitro_ models to evaluate species-specific effects of coastal seawater of Hong Kong, a representative area for cetacean health and marine pollution. While distinct cytotoxic susceptibilities to seawater extracts and the tested chemicals occurred in species-specific cell lines, pectenotoxin-2, despite its low chemical load, emerged as the predominant contributor to cytotoxicity in identified chemical mixtures, surpassing the effects of the studied anthropogenic contaminants across both cetacean cell lines.
