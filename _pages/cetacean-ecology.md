# Bayesian Weaning Age Analysis [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-logo?style=flat-square&logo=Github&color=000000)](https://github.com/YuenWaHo/EEP-Sousa-WeaningAge)

This part of my research focus on the ontogenetic dietary shift of humpback dolphins (_Sousa chinensis_) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. This research aims to provide valuable insights into the life history and ecology of this humpback dolphins, as well as highlight the conservation implications for their future. By examining the dentine nitrogen isotopic values in the teeth of stranded humpback dolphins, we were able to trace the ontogenetic dietary shifts in these animals, revealing important information about their weaning age and feeding habits.

This study focused on tooth samples collected from 95 humpback dolphin carcasses that stranded ashore between 2007 and 2018 in the PRD region. This area encompasses the estuarine system of the Pearl River (Pearl River Estuary, PRE) and adjacent coastal habitats from Hong Kong in the east to Jiangmen in the west. By using the high-precision micro-milling technique, we extracted dentine samples from the teeth and analyzed them for stable isotopes. We then employed a Bayesian framework with a two-stage linear switch-point model to estimate the age at which the ontogenetic dietary shift occurred, as well as the pre- and post-weaning slopes.

The results revealed individual heterogeneity in the age of ontogenetic dietary shift, with the population mean weaning age estimated at 2.39 years. This finding contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the life history traits and dietary ecology of humpback dolphins in the PRD region, which is essential for effective conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, by examining spatial patterns and differences, we were able to gain a better understanding of the population structure and potential threats faced by these dolphins in their respective habitats.

# Resources Partitioning (SIBER)

The longitudinal isotopic records archived in dolphin teeth and analysed in this study demonstrate that fine-scale dentine isotopic values vary between sexes and regions, signifying the intra-specific foraging patterns. The results indate that male humpback dolphins occupied a larger isotopic niche area and consumed prey items from a more depleted carbon sources. Isotopic niche area were shown to decrease towards the western side of the PRD region, with a considerable overlap in niche space between adjacent regions. The isotopic niche area were shown to decrease as the total fishery production increase, likely suggesting the effect of anthropogenic pressure on resource consumption pattern of humpback dolphins throughout the study period.
