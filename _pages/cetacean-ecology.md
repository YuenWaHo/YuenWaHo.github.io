This part of my research focus on the ontogenetic dietary shift of humpback dolphins (_Sousa chinensis_) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. This research aims to provide valuable insights into the life history and ecology of this humpback dolphins, as well as highlight the conservation implications for their future. By examining the dentine nitrogen isotopic values in the teeth of stranded humpback dolphins, we were able to trace the ontogenetic dietary shifts in these animals, revealing important information about their weaning age and feeding habits.

The results revealed individual heterogeneity in the age of ontogenetic dietary shift, with the population mean weaning age estimated at 2.39 years. This finding contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the life history traits and dietary ecology of humpback dolphins in the PRD region, which is essential for effective conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, by examining spatial patterns and differences, we were able to gain a better understanding of the population structure and potential threats faced by these dolphins in their respective habitats.

# Resources Partitioning (SIBER)

Manuscript in Preparation

The longitudinal isotopic records archived in dolphin teeth and analysed in this study demonstrate that fine-scale dentine isotopic values vary between sexes and regions, signifying the intra-specific foraging patterns. The results indate that male humpback dolphins occupied a larger isotopic niche area and consumed prey items from a more depleted carbon sources. Isotopic niche area were shown to decrease towards the western side of the PRD region, with a considerable overlap in niche space between adjacent regions. The isotopic niche area were shown to decrease as the total fishery production increase, likely suggesting the effect of anthropogenic pressure on resource consumption pattern of humpback dolphins throughout the study period.
