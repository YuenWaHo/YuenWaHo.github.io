This study investigates ontogenetic dietary shifts in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (_Sousa chinensis_) from the Pearl River Delta. By analyzing nitrogen isotope ratios in dentine growth-layer groups from stranded individuals, the analysis traces weaning age and subsequent feeding patterns. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was applied to quantify individual variation and estimate the population-level mean weaning age.

Results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity among individuals, with a population mean weaning age of 2.39 years. These findings refine knowledge of humpback dolphin life-history traits and dietary ecology in the PRD region, informing targeted conservation and management measures. Spatial analyses further reveal subpopulation structure and highlight habitat-specific threats, underscoring the importance of regionally tailored protection strategies.

## Resources Partitioning (SIBER)

_Manuscript in Preparation_

The longitudinal isotopic records archived in dolphin teeth and analysed in this study demonstrate that fine-scale dentine isotopic values vary between sexes and regions, signifying the intra-specific foraging patterns. The results indate that male humpback dolphins occupied a larger isotopic niche area and consumed prey items from a more depleted carbon sources. Isotopic niche area were shown to decrease towards the western side of the PRD region, with a considerable overlap in niche space between adjacent regions. The isotopic niche area were shown to decrease as the total fishery production increase, likely suggesting the effect of anthropogenic pressure on resource consumption pattern of humpback dolphins throughout the study period.
