We havd a unusual stranding in Hong Kong late last year. It was confirmed to be one of the rarest cetacean in the world - Longman's beaked whale (or Tropical bottlenose whale; _Indopacetus pacificus_). Thank you to AFCD for providing the permit for handling the whale skeleton for osteological study and education purpose. Currently it's under defleshing using black soldier fly larvae. The next step is to degrease the bones using soapy water. A STEAM programme will be organised for high school students to experience degreasing such a rare specimen.
